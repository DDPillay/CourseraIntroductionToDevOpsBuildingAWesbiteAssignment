title: Sweet and Simple Lemon Tart
---
# Ingredients
## Crust
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ¼ cup sifted confectioners' sugar
- 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour

## Filling
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or more to taste
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon peel (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

# Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
2. Make the crust: Mix butter and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl until smooth; stir in flour. Press dough into the prepared baking pan; pierce with a fork in several places to prevent crust from puffing up during baking.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool, 15 to 30 minutes. Leave the oven on.
4. Make the filling: Whisk white sugar and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk in flour, lemon juice, lemon peel, and salt until thoroughly combined; pour into cooled crust.
5. Bake until filling is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely, then dust with confectioners' sugar and cut into 16 squares. Serve immediately, or refrigerate and serve chilled.
