# Ingredients
- Flour
- Baking powder
- Salt
- Shortening
- Milk

# Directions
1. Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Cut in the shortening, then add the milk. Mix until the dough is soft and doesn't stick to the side of the bowl.
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Roll the dough into an even sheet that's about Â½-inch thick.
3. Use a lightly floured biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the cut biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Re-roll the dough, repeating the cutting process, until all the dough is gone. Bake until golden brown.
